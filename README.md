# üé∞ CFR Poker AI - Final Outputs

## What You Got

These are the final production-ready files for your poker AI system:

1. **aiplayer.py** - The main AI player that uses your trained CFR strategies
2. **test_complete.py** - Comprehensive test suite to validate everything works
3. **README.md** - This file

## Quick Start

### 1. Make sure you have your strategy file
You should already have `cfr_strategies.pkl` from the strategy generation step. If not, generate it first.

### 2. Test the AI
```bash
# Run the complete test suite
python test_complete.py
```

This will run 6 comprehensive tests:
- ‚úÖ Strategy file validation
- ‚úÖ Preflop hand bucketing
- ‚úÖ Strategy coherence (do strategies make poker sense?)
- ‚úÖ Action sampling distribution
- ‚úÖ Full hand simulation
- ‚úÖ API interface compatibility

### 3. Quick manual test
```bash
# Run the AI player directly
python aiplayer.py
```

This will show you example hands being played.

## What Each File Does

### aiplayer.py

The core AI player with these key functions:

```python
# Load the AI
player = CFRAIPlayer("cfr_strategies.pkl")

# Get a strategy (probabilities for all actions)
strategy = player.get_strategy("preflop", ["As", "Kh"], [])
# Returns: {"fold": 0.05, "call": 0.25, "raise": 0.70}

# Get a single action (sampled from strategy)
action = player.get_action("flop", ["Qs", "Jh"], ["Ah", "Kh", "7c"])
# Returns: "call" or "raise" or "bet" or "fold"

# Get bucket info (for debugging)
bucket, raw_strategy = player.get_bucket_info("river", ["9s", "8s"], [...])
```

### test_complete.py

Runs 6 different tests to make sure everything is working:

1. **Strategy File Test** - Verifies your CFR strategies loaded correctly
2. **Bucketing Test** - Checks that hands are grouped sensibly (AA=premium, 72=trash)
3. **Coherence Test** - Verifies strategies make poker sense (AA should raise, etc.)
4. **Sampling Test** - Confirms action sampling matches probabilities
5. **Simulation Test** - Plays through a complete hand
6. **API Test** - Verifies the interface works for web deployment

## Integration Examples

### Use in a FastAPI backend

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from aiplayer import CFRAIPlayer

app = FastAPI()
player = CFRAIPlayer()

@app.post("/get_action")
async def get_action(request: dict):
    stage = request["stage"]
    hole_cards = request["hole_cards"]
    board = request.get("board", [])
    
    action = player.get_action(stage, hole_cards, board)
    strategy = player.get_strategy(stage, hole_cards, board)
    
    return {
        "action": action,
        "strategy": strategy
    }
```

### Use with Claude API for coaching

```python
from aiplayer import CFRAIPlayer
import anthropic

player = CFRAIPlayer()
claude = anthropic.Client(api_key="your-key")

def get_coaching(hole_cards, board, stage):
    # Get GTO strategy from CFR solver
    strategy = player.get_strategy(stage, hole_cards, board)
    
    # Get natural language explanation from Claude
    prompt = f"""
    I have {hole_cards[0]}{hole_cards[1]} on the {stage}.
    Board: {board}
    
    The GTO solver recommends:
    {strategy}
    
    Explain this strategy in simple terms. Why should I play this way?
    """
    
    response = claude.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        max_tokens=500,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    
    return response.content[0].text
```

## Common Issues

### "Strategy file not found"
Make sure `cfr_strategies.pkl` is in the same directory as `aiplayer.py`. If you haven't generated it yet, run the strategy generation script first.

### "Module not found: numpy"
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

### Actions don't match expected strategy
This is normal! The AI **samples** from the strategy distribution. If AA has:
- Fold: 10%
- Call: 20%
- Raise: 70%

Then over 100 hands with AA, you'll see roughly 10 folds, 20 calls, and 70 raises. Each individual action is random, but the distribution converges over time.

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Create FastAPI wrapper** - Expose the AI via REST API
2. **Deploy to Render/Railway** - Host the Python backend
3. **Connect Next.js frontend** - Call the API from your Supalaunch app
4. **Add Claude coaching** - Natural language explanations on top of GTO math
5. **Add hand history analysis** - Let users upload hands for review
6. **Add session tracking** - Track user progress over time

## What Makes This Good

Unlike most "poker AI" apps that are just ChatGPT wrappers:

‚úÖ **Real CFR solver** - Actual game theory optimal calculations
‚úÖ **Proper hand abstraction** - 9 preflop buckets, equity-based postflop
‚úÖ **Trained strategies** - Not hardcoded, but learned through self-play
‚úÖ **Production-ready** - Clean API, tested, ready to deploy
‚úÖ **Extensible** - Easy to add Claude coaching, hand history, etc.

## Questions?

The AI is now ready to go! Run the tests, and if everything passes, you can deploy this backend and connect it to your Next.js frontend.

Good luck crushing the tables! üÉè‚ô†Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
