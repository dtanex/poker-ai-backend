# ü§ñ Using Claude Code with Your Poker AI

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a command-line tool that lets Claude help you with coding tasks directly from your terminal. It's like having an AI pair programmer.

## Quick Start with Claude Code

### 1. Make sure Claude Code is installed
```bash
# Check if installed
claude-code --version

# If not installed, follow instructions at:
# https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code
```

### 2. Navigate to your project directory
```bash
cd /path/to/your/poker-ai-project
```

### 3. Place all the files in the same directory

Your directory should look like:
```
poker-ai/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aiplayer.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cfr_trainer.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fastapi_backend.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_complete.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CRITICAL_REVIEW.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (cfr_strategies.pkl will be generated)
```

## How to Communicate Files to Claude Code

### Method 1: Ask Claude Code to read them (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Start Claude Code in your project directory
claude-code

# Then in the chat:
```

**Example conversation:**
```
You: Read all the Python files in this directory and tell me what the poker AI does

Claude: [reads aiplayer.py, cfr_trainer.py, etc. and explains]

You: Now help me deploy this to Render

Claude: [provides step-by-step deployment instructions]
```

### Method 2: Reference files explicitly

```bash
claude-code "Read aiplayer.py and fastapi_backend.py. How do I connect these to my Next.js frontend?"
```

### Method 3: Use file attachments (if supported)

Some versions of Claude Code let you attach files:
```bash
claude-code --file aiplayer.py --file fastapi_backend.py "Review this code"
```

## Common Tasks with Claude Code

### Task 1: Train the AI and test it

```bash
claude-code "Help me run the training pipeline:
1. Run cfr_trainer.py to generate strategies
2. Run test_complete.py to verify everything works
3. Show me the results"
```

Claude will:
- Run `python cfr_trainer.py`
- Wait for it to complete
- Run `python test_complete.py`
- Show you the test results
- Explain any issues

### Task 2: Deploy to Render

```bash
claude-code "I want to deploy this FastAPI backend to Render. Walk me through it step by step."
```

Claude will:
- Help you create a Render account
- Guide you through the deployment
- Help you configure environment variables
- Test the deployed API

### Task 3: Integrate with Next.js frontend

```bash
claude-code "My Next.js app is at /path/to/supalaunch. 
Help me create an API client to connect to the FastAPI backend.
The backend is at https://my-poker-api.onrender.com"
```

Claude will:
- Create an API client file
- Show you how to call the endpoints
- Help you integrate with your UI

### Task 4: Add Claude API coaching

```bash
claude-code "Read fastapi_backend.py. 
The /coaching endpoint needs Claude API integration.
Help me add natural language explanations using the Anthropic SDK."
```

Claude will:
- Add `anthropic` to requirements.txt
- Implement the coaching endpoint
- Show you how to set the API key
- Test the integration

### Task 5: Debug issues

```bash
claude-code "I'm getting this error when running test_complete.py:
[paste error message]

Debug it for me."
```

Claude will:
- Analyze the error
- Find the root cause
- Fix the code
- Verify the fix works

## Pro Tips for Claude Code

### 1. Be specific about context
```bash
# ‚ùå Bad
claude-code "fix the bug"

# ‚úÖ Good
claude-code "There's a KeyError in aiplayer.py line 45 when I call get_strategy() with a new bucket. Fix it."
```

### 2. Ask for explanations
```bash
claude-code "Explain how the CFR training algorithm works in cfr_trainer.py. 
Why do we use regret matching?"
```

### 3. Request documentation
```bash
claude-code "Add docstrings to all functions in fastapi_backend.py 
so other developers can understand the API."
```

### 4. Get deployment help
```bash
claude-code "I need to deploy this to production. 
1. Create a Dockerfile
2. Add environment variable management
3. Set up logging
4. Add rate limiting"
```

### 5. Optimize performance
```bash
claude-code "The CFR training is too slow. 
Profile cfr_trainer.py and optimize the bottlenecks."
```

## Example: Complete Deployment Workflow

Here's a full conversation flow for deploying your poker AI:

```bash
# Step 1: Review code
claude-code "Review all Python files and tell me if there are any bugs or issues before deployment"

# Step 2: Train the AI
claude-code "Run python cfr_trainer.py and show me the output"

# Step 3: Test everything
claude-code "Run python test_complete.py. If any tests fail, fix them."

# Step 4: Prepare for deployment
claude-code "I want to deploy to Render. 
1. Check if requirements.txt has all dependencies
2. Create a start script
3. Explain the deployment steps"

# Step 5: Deploy
claude-code "Walk me through deploying to Render step by step. 
Wait for my confirmation after each step."

# Step 6: Test deployed API
claude-code "Test the deployed API at https://my-api.onrender.com/health
If it works, show me how to call the /strategy endpoint."

# Step 7: Connect frontend
claude-code "Now help me integrate this with my Next.js app in /path/to/supalaunch"
```

## What Claude Code CAN Help With

‚úÖ Running Python scripts  
‚úÖ Debugging errors  
‚úÖ Explaining code  
‚úÖ Deploying to cloud services  
‚úÖ Creating config files (Dockerfile, etc.)  
‚úÖ Writing tests  
‚úÖ Optimizing performance  
‚úÖ Adding features  
‚úÖ Integrating with other services  

## What Claude Code CANNOT Do

‚ùå Access external URLs directly (but can help you write code to do it)  
‚ùå Run for hours (sessions have time limits)  
‚ùå Access your git credentials (you'll need to push manually)  

## Alternative: Use Regular Claude + Copy/Paste

If you don't have Claude Code, you can still use regular Claude:

1. **Paste the files into chat:**
```
Here's my aiplayer.py:
[paste full file]

Here's my fastapi_backend.py:
[paste full file]

Help me deploy this to Render.
```

2. **Claude will analyze and help**

3. **Copy the commands/code Claude provides and run them yourself**

It's slower than Claude Code but works the same way.

## Getting Help

If you're stuck:

1. **Check the docs:** https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code
2. **Ask Claude:** "I'm confused about how to use Claude Code for my poker AI project. Explain it step by step."
3. **Start simple:** Just try `claude-code "Read aiplayer.py and explain what it does"`

## Summary: Your Workflow

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd ~/poker-ai

# 2. Start Claude Code
claude-code

# 3. In the Claude Code chat:
"Read all the Python files. I want to:
1. Train the CFR strategies
2. Test everything
3. Deploy to Render
4. Connect to my Next.js frontend

Walk me through it step by step."

# Claude will guide you through everything!
```

That's it! Claude Code makes this whole process way easier than doing it manually.
